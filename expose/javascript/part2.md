1. Outputs 3. Because after the iteration, the value of i turned to be 3.
2. Outputs 150. Because the variable "discountedlPrice" saves the value of the price after the discounting calculation. 300*(1-0.5)=150.
3. Outputs 150. Because the variable "finalPrice" saves the value of the nearest integer of the discounted price. 300*(1-0.5)=150. The nearest integer is 150.
4. The array reserving the discounted price. Because the array "discounted" saves the values of discounted prices.
5. ReferenceError: i is not defined. Because "let" defined the variable locally, "var" has no block scope. This position is out of the range of "let".
6. ReferenceError: discountPrice is not defined. Because "let" defined the variable locally. This position is out of the range of "let".
7. Outputs 150. Because the variable "finalPrice" saves the value of the nearest integer of the discounted price. 300*(1-0.5)=150. The nearest integer is 150. This position is inside the range of "let".
8. The array reserving the discounted price. Because the array "discounted" saves the values of discounted prices. This position is inside the range of "let".
9. ReferenceError: i is not defined. Because "let" defined the variable locally. This position is out of the range of "let".
10. Outputs 3. Because after the iteration, the value of i turned to be 3.
11. The array reserving the discounted price. Because the array "discounted" saves the values of discounted prices.
12. A. name; B. 'Grad Year'; C. greeting; D. 'Favorite Teacher'; E.courseLoad
13. A. '32'; B. 1; C. 3; D. '3null'; E. 4; F. 0; G.'3undefined'; H.NaN
14. A. true; B.false; C. true; D. false; E. false; F. true
15.  == is used for comparing two variables, but it ignores the datatype of variable whereas === is used for comparing two variables, but this operator also checks datatype and compares two values.
17. Return the array "newArr" with the value 2 4 6. This is because the mechanism of callback function let array[i] be executed by function "doSomething" before pushing into the newArr array.
19. Every Second, the program outputs
    1
    4
    3
    then, after 1 second's delay, the program outputs
    2
    Above is a period of the loop. The program is in the infinite loop and will output as above every second.
